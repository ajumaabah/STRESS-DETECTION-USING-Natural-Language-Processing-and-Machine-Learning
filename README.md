# STRESS-DETECTION-USING-Natural-Language-Processing-and-Machine-Learning
MSc Data Science Masters Project


# Aim and Scope of the Project
This study uses machine learning and natural language processing to identify stress in social media conversations. Once more, the research aims to categorise the attitudes behind social media messages using binary classifications.
A collection of extensive multi-domain social media data from five distinct Reddit forums for recognizing stress. We offer an exploratory examination of a Reddit post dataset utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling and visualization, as well as a machine learning model to predict future posts, in this work. In this study, we examined the dataset using LDA to determine the number of topics and the proportion of words in each topic. The machine learning models have also been fine-tuned for the sentiment classification of two distinct classes: stress (1) and non-stress (0). The machine learning algorithms employed in this study include logistic regression, XGBoost, and SVM. To scrape posts for our test prediction, a web application is constructed with web scraping software for Reddit.


# Research Objectives
1.	To classify sentiments behind social media conversations using binary classifications. 
2.	To perform modelling and visualization using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which computes a topic structure by an iterative method while taking into account the density of each topic.
3.	To accurately assess and categorise user thoughts and forecast future posts.


# Conclusion 
In conclusion, this project analyzed Reddit comments of various users to predict if a user comment shows stress or no stress. A webpage was created to give an output showing stress or non-stressed comments. The website is useful for demonstrating the application of machine learning to analyze and predict the sentiment of Reddit comments. It has a simple form on the homepage that allows users to easily input and submit Reddit comments for analysis. The website also allows users to test the model with other texts and see how well it performs in classifying Reddit comments. Additionally, the website allows users to fetch fresh data for prediction.
